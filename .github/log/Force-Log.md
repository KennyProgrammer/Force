  - RenderEngine2D: Prepare class RenderEngine2D for batch rendering system.   
  - SceneManagment: Again upgrade game object system. Now all transform stuff move to Transformation component class. This is not full version of this class, i will also add support to geetting matrix from it and other cool stuff.   
  - SceneManagment: Try to attempt to add very early game object system to the engine. Next step be components system.   
  - Runtime: Try create basic template my favorite game geometry dash in CTXEngine.   
  - Common: These are very big changes in the code. Because I organized the files closer to the folders by namespace. That is, now there is a part of the Core engine, it includes a control system, then Renderer which is responsible for rendering, with all the API. And also made many other sorts in the code.   
  - RenderEngine2D: Upgrade the render engine 2d, now support textures with alpha channel and textures with colours and alpha. Moved two shaders in one GameObject.glsl. Its boost perfomance very well, because gpu don't need at runtime switch between this shader programs. Also fixed much small bugs, and improve better camera movement. Now camera follow by player.

  - Core: Made few refactoring in the code. Moved all CTX defines to CoreBase. And also add templates to easy putting some stuff, such a std::vector, std::*_ptr. And finally create shader abstraction.   
  - Graphics: Finally base of RenderEngine is fully complete! Now render engine set the uses rendeing api (for now open gl) and dispatch it. Also now RenderEngineHelper stores data about rendering commands. And if current api is open gl then load GLRenderEngine impl and runs it functions.   
  - Graphics: Upgrade the rendering, add attrubite buffer layouts to easy put attribute (offset, stride). For now remove Abstraction GLVertexArrayObject, but in next commit it's be more better.   
  - Graphics: Improve renderer and add shader support.   
  - Graphics: Create platform specific rendering api's context, and improve renderer.   
  - Core: Now engine use static link (.lib) instead (.dll). And also fix other bugs with warnings on build.
