	- Core: Application System: Element + Scene + App structure recreation and fixing Editor events.   
	- RenderEngine2D: Support More that 32 textures on Render + black rect on some devices.   
	- Editor: Editor Viewport + Upgrade light.   
	- Common: Basic 2D Lighting.   
	- Editor: Editor Space + Project.   
	- RenderEngine2D: Engine now support raw batch rendering system, also updated buffer's classes.   
	- RenderEngine2D: Prepare class RenderEngine2D for batch rendering system.   
	- SceneManagment: Again upgrade game object system. Now all transform stuff move to Transformation component class. This is not full version of this class, i will also add support to geetting matrix from it and other cool stuff.   
	- SceneManagment: Try to attempt to add very early game object system to the engine. Next step be components system.   
	- Runtime: Try create basic template my favorite game geometry dash in CTXEngine.   
	- Common: These are very big changes in the code. Because I organized the files closer to the folders by namespace. That is, now there is a part of the Core engine, it includes a control system, then Renderer which is responsible for rendering, with all the API. And also made many other sorts in the code.   
	- RenderEngine2D: Upgrade the render engine 2d, now support textures with alpha channel and textures with colours and alpha. Moved two shaders in one GameObject.glsl. Its boost perfomance very well, because gpu don't need at runtime switch between this shader programs. Also fixed much small bugs, and improve better camera movement. Now camera follow by player.  
	- RenderEngine2D: Started to create specicfic 2d render engine, because it be very imporatnt in the future for exampe uis-guis.   
	- Graphics: Add textures iwth blending support, upgrade asset engine pack, and do many small changes with optimization and code.   
	- Core: Made few refactoring in the code. Moved all CTX defines to CoreBase. And also add templates to easy putting some stuff, such a std::vector, std::*_ptr. And finally create shader abstraction.   
	- Graphics: Finally base of RenderEngine is fully complete! Now render engine set the uses rendeing api (for now open gl) and dispatch it. Also now RenderEngineHelper stores data about rendering commands. And if current api is open gl then load GLRenderEngine impl and runs it functions.   
	- Graphics: Upgrade the rendering, add attrubite buffer layouts to easy put attribute (offset, stride). For now remove Abstraction GLVertexArrayObject, but in next commit it's be more better.   
	- Graphics: Improve renderer and add shader support.   
	- Graphics: Create platform specific rendering api's context, and improve renderer.   
	- Core: Now engine use static link (.lib) instead (.dll). And also fix other bugs with warnings on build.   
	- ImGui: Update ImGui to Docking Branch.   
	- Graphics: Patricles and SubTextures support.   
	- Math: Add GLM (Math library) support.   
	- IO: Windows Input support.   
	- Github: Here should be first first initial commit on Force/Craftix repository, but i create repositiry few weeks later, then delete it again or break. (Because i did't know how git works :D)
	- GLFW: Add first Window.   
	- ImGui: Start working on supporting reciving events from ImGui in ImGuiElement.   
	- Graphics: Dear's ImGui. Add ImGui library and OpenGL + GLFW backends to render ImGui.   
	- Graphics: OpenGL and GLAD. Add glad extension loader for OpenGL functions.   
	- Element System: Add support for raw Element/Layer system and write the GameLayer for test.   
	- Core: Now all .cpp files includes the Precompile headers.

	- Core: Add PreMake5 support for build engine projects.   
	- Core: Add Logger library SpdLog for logging debug messages to console and debug application.    
	- Core: Entry Point. Make a basic main entry point for Application.
