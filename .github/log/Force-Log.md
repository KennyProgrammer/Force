# Force-Log

0.3.9 to 0.4.0:   
    - ...      
	
**0.3.9pre1:**   
	- Scripting: Expands the Scripting API (Debug, GameObject), add Window, PrimitiveType, Utils, Vector2i, Vector2i.   
	- Scripting: Major scripting update. Now all core of C# library stores in different module ForceCSCore.dll that now links to user scripts file ForceCS.dll.   
	- Scripting: Now project link the ForceCSCore.dll directly to EditorPath.
	- Project: Add to config EditorPath and LastEditorPath to save the editor path for linking other dynamic libraries.   
	- SceneManagment: Fix bugs with scene manager, replace RemoveByAddress on Unload for removing scene from memory.   
	- SceneManagment: Add support for sorting gameobject node by name, uuid, transform.   
	- Core: Element System: Improve the element system, add category for element and advanced callaback sending via ElementCallbackClass.   
	- Scripting: Starting work on SceneManager API for script, add Scene.cs and SceneManager.cs classes, and now C++ SceneManager has termin of scenes that was created by script at runtime.   
	- Inspector & Explorer: Components View now will displayed specific for Edit Mode and Runtime Mode. In runtine when we select object on scene from script Explorer will send the context to Inspector.   
	- Core: Application System: Replace old Config class by new ApplicationSpecificaion.   
	- Core: Application System: Add ApplicationCmdArgsSpecification, ApplicationWindowSpecification. Now application knows about its worlking path and resources directory.   
	- Runtime: Add new ForceRuntime project. This project will used to play final excecutable project/product.   
	- Core: Application System: Add ApplicationUserSpecification instead of Project::ProjectConfig. Remove Project::ProjectConfig.   
	- Core: Application System: Now instead ForceConfig.json Force creates ForceUser.json from ApplicationUserSpecification.   
	- Runtime: Start working on integration playable runtime application. Starts with RuntimeElement.   
	- Runtime: Completed playable runtime application. Now at this point user project that created in Editor can be run inside Force Runtime shell, and be kinda executable.      
    - Runtime: Now runtime application have two state of excetution, one is when we run in IDE (search by start project path and use ForceUser.json), and second is final game app (all assets, resources and paths relative to game .exe file).   
	- Runtime: Add support for raw application exporting in Force Editor (Build), only throw Force solution, other no have any idea how to implement.   
	- Platform: Window: Add support for maximize window for ShowWindow function, add PayWindowAttention funtion.   
	- Editor: Add Platfrom Configuration settings and Scenes Build settings. Now this settings does nothing.

	- Platfrom: Window: Add MouseCursorType enum. Win32: Fix not even loaded cursor. (Founds out when remove ImGuiElement and test without it.).]
	- Core: Application System: Refresh, redising, update, remove unnessisary code.   
	- Platform: Now platform detects not as part of Application, but part of each OS Entry Point.   
	- Scripting: Now scripting backend initialize not by Application, by platform Entry Point. Because Mono JIT cannot be reloaded if it was CleanUp.   
	- Graphics: Match all graphics creation code to PlatfromLibraryAPI.   
	- D3D10/D3D11: Fix the bug with not setted primitive topology, to render all primitives as lines not triangles.

	- Editor: Add renderer support for building. Uncomplited.   
	- Core: Application System: Update the application system, add Core.h/cpp files that initialize the core systems. Improve closing via new Shutdown function. Now application update loop is updates by running flag not by window->IsCloseRequested.   
	- Nave: Starting working on super simple Launcher for Force (Force Nave).   
	- Core: Now user can use ManagedInitializeCore() to disable Core engine.   
	- Core: Application System: Now user can disable rendering and audio engines. (But it will still links and requrie DLL's.)   
	- Nave: Raw implement the Force Builds (Installs) property.

**(For this special thanks to TheCherno "Yan Chernikov" and its GameEngine series!)**   
**0.1.20 to 0.1.21.3.12 (The Core Pipeline Update):**   
	- Core: Application System: New Configuration System.   
	- Core: Application System: Element + Scene + App structure recreation and fixing Editor events.   
	- RenderEngine2D: Support More that 32 textures on Render + black rect on some devices.   
	- Editor: Editor Viewport + Upgrade light.   
	- Common: Basic 2D Lighting.   
	- Editor: Editor Space + Project.   
	- RenderEngine2D: Engine now support raw batch rendering system, also updated buffer's classes.   
	- RenderEngine2D: Prepare class RenderEngine2D for batch rendering system.   
	- SceneManagment: Again upgrade game object system. Now all transform stuff move to Transformation component class. This is not full version of this class, i will also add support to geetting matrix from it and other cool stuff.   
	- SceneManagment: Try to attempt to add very early game object system to the engine. Next step be components system.   
	- Runtime: Try create basic template my favorite game geometry dash in CTXEngine.   
	- Common: These are very big changes in the code. Because I organized the files closer to the folders by namespace. That is, now there is a part of the Core engine, it includes a control system, then Renderer which is responsible for rendering, with all the API. And also made many other sorts in the code.   
	- RenderEngine2D: Upgrade the render engine 2d, now support textures with alpha channel and textures with colours and alpha. Moved two shaders in one GameObject.glsl. Its boost perfomance very well, because gpu don't need at runtime switch between this shader programs. Also fixed much small bugs, and improve better camera movement. Now camera follow by player.  
	- RenderEngine2D: Started to create specicfic 2d render engine, because it be very imporatnt in the future for exampe uis-guis.   
	- Graphics: Add textures iwth blending support, upgrade asset engine pack, and do many small changes with optimization and code.   
	- Core: Made few refactoring in the code. Moved all CTX defines to CoreBase. And also add templates to easy putting some stuff, such a std::vector, std::*_ptr. And finally create shader abstraction.   
	- Graphics: Finally base of RenderEngine is fully complete! Now render engine set the uses rendeing api (for now open gl) and dispatch it. Also now RenderEngineHelper stores data about rendering commands. And if current api is open gl then load GLRenderEngine impl and runs it functions.   
	- Graphics: Upgrade the rendering, add attrubite buffer layouts to easy put attribute (offset, stride). For now remove Abstraction GLVertexArrayObject, but in next commit it's be more better.   
	- Graphics: Improve renderer and add shader support.   
	- Graphics: Create platform specific rendering api's context, and improve renderer.   
	- Core: Now engine use static link (.lib) instead (.dll). And also fix other bugs with warnings on build.   
	- ImGui: Update ImGui to Docking Branch.   
	- Graphics: Patricles and SubTextures support.   
	- Math: Add GLM (Math library) support.   
	- IO: Windows Input support.   
	- Github: Here should be first first initial commit on Force/Craftix repository, but i create repositiry few weeks later, then delete it again or break. (Because i did't know how git works :D)
	- GLFW: Add first Window.   
	- ImGui: Start working on supporting reciving events from ImGui in ImGuiElement.   
	- Graphics: Dear's ImGui. Add ImGui library and OpenGL + GLFW backends to render ImGui.   
	- Graphics: OpenGL and GLAD. Add glad extension loader for OpenGL functions.   
	- Element System: Add support for raw Element/Layer system and write the GameLayer for test.   
	- Core: Now all .cpp files includes the Precompile headers.   
	- IO: Start working on input system for Craftix. Basic inplmenetation uses GLFW in the Core.   
	- Core: Add PreMake5 support for build engine projects.   
	- Core: Add Logger library SpdLog for logging debug messages to console and debug application.    
	- Core: Entry Point. Make a basic main entry point for Application.
