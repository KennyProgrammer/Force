## Introduction

**Force** was developing by one person [Danil Dukhovenko](https://github.com/KennyProgrammer) from [January 2020](https://danil-dukhovenko.gitbook.io/force/other/insider) and still by present day. Force still on very early stage, because working on it by myself. So it needs get a lot more features for now to left this early stage. In future where engine steps some **stability point**, i will attach other developers, and create open source-community driven technology. 

If you interesed you can check Force global [Roadmap](.github/Force-RoadMap.md) to see completed and not yet completed features.
